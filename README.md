# Sort Array Values
This Java program allows you to enter elements into an array and sorts them in ascending order.

## Introduction

The program prompts you to enter the size of the array and the elements you want to store in it. It then sorts the array in ascending order using the `Arrays.sort()` method from the Java standard library.
